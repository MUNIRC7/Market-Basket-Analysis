In the world of retail and e-commerce, understanding customer purchasing patterns is key to driving sales and improving product recommendations. My Market Basket Analysis project is designed to discover insights into customer buying behaviour by examining transactional data and identifying associations between products.

Using techniques such as association rule mining and Apriori, I was able to detect product pairings that frequently occur together. By calculating metrics like support, confidence, and lift, this project provides valuable insights into which products are often purchased in tandem, guiding decision-making for inventory management, promotions, and cross-selling strategies.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw transactional data into a format suitable for market basket analysis.
Apriori Algorithm: Employed the Apriori algorithm to uncover frequent product sets and identify strong associations between items.
Visualization: Used Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize relationships and trends within the dataset.
Association Metrics: Calculated support, confidence, lift, and conviction to evaluate the strength of product associations.
CSV Export: The association rules and metrics were exported as a CSV file for further analysis or integration into recommendation systems.
Tools and Technologies:
Python: Core programming language for implementing the analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and transformation.
Mlxtend: Used for association rule mining.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For generating insightful visualizations of product associations.
Business Value:
The insights generated from this market basket analysis can be applied to:

Cross-selling and upselling: Recommending products that are frequently bought together.
Inventory optimization: Ensuring that frequently paired products are adequately stocked.
Targeted promotions: Designing bundle offers and discounts based on common product combinations.
